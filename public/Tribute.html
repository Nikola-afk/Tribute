            the transmission of electrical power without wires. It was an expansion of his idea of using coils to transmit power 
            that he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting. He saw this as not only a way to transmit large amounts of power 
            around the world but also, as he had pointed out in his earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications.
